  ## User Story

  AS A developer
  I WANT a README generator
  SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
  WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
  THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
  WHEN I enter my project title
  THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
  WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
  THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
  WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
  THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
  WHEN I enter my GitHub username
  THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
  WHEN I enter my email address
  THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
  WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
  THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

  ## Installation

  Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
  
  ## Features
  
  If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
  
  ## How to Contribute
  
  If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
  
  ## Tests
  
  To test use the command node index.js and try different answers.
